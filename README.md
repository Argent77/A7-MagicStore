## Overview

The game contains a great number of stores for your shopping needs. However, finding or returning to a store can take a lot of time or is sometimes not even possible.

This mod allows you to acquire a magical artifact that provides the means to visit any store you have visited in the past. Getting your hands on this unique artifact involves a small quest of one kind or another.

The mod supports the following games and game variants:
- Original BG2
- Tutu/EasyTutu
- BGT (Baldur's Gate Trilogy)
- BG:EE
- SoD (Siege of Dragonspear)
- BG2:EE
- EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy)
- IWD:EE

## Components

### Magic Store of Vergadain *(for BG2, Tutu, BGT, BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE, EET and IWD:EE)*

This is the main component. It installs the artifact "Magic Store of Vergadain" and associates it with a small quest.

The Magic Store keeps track of the stores you visit throughout the game, so you can visit them later at any time and place even if the original store becomes unavailable. Activating the artifact summons a ghostly merchant who offers a list of available stores for your shopping needs.

The store can be installed in two variants:
1) <ins>Fee required:</ins> The ghostly merchant will charge you a fee whenever you wish to access a store. The amount depends on the current game or campaign. It starts with 25 gold in BG1 and doubles with each campaign: 50 gold in SoD, 100 gold in BG2:SoA and 200 gold in BG2:ToB. In IWD:EE the fee is always 50 gold.

2) <ins>Free of charge:</ins> The ghostly merchant won't charge you when you wish to access a store.

Each game campaign provides their own small quest to get access to the Magic Store of Vergadain.

### Alternate portrait for Ghostly Merchant *(requires main component)*

This optional component installs an alternate portrait version of the Ghostly Merchant without ghostly features.

### Restrict available services in summoned stores *(requires main component, EE games only)*

Some of the available services can be easily abused, such as resting or healing in the middle of combat.

This optional component allows you to restrict the services offered by the summoned stores.

### Tweak item charges of the Magic Store *(requires main component)*

This optional component allows you to tweak number and type of item charges for the Magic Store of Vergadain.
