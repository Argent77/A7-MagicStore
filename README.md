# Magic Store of Vergadain
*A magical artifact that allows access to stores from all over the world.*

## Overview

The game contains a great number of stores for your shopping needs. However, finding or returning to a store can take a lot of time or is sometimes not even possible.

This mod allows you to acquire a magical artifact that provides the means to visit any store you have visited in the past. Getting your hands on this unique artifact involves a small quest of one kind or another.

The mod supports the following games and game variants:
- Original BG2
- Tutu/EasyTutu
- BGT (Baldur's Gate Trilogy)
- BG:EE
- SoD (Siege of Dragonspear)
- BG2:EE
- EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy)
- IWD:EE

## Components

### Magic Store of Vergadain *(for BG2, Tutu, BGT, BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE, EET and IWD:EE)*

This is the main component. It installs the artifact "Magic Store of Vergadain" and associates it with a small quest.

The Magic Store keeps track of the stores you visit throughout the game, so you can visit them later at any time and place even if the original store becomes unavailable. Activating the artifact summons a ghostly merchant who offers a list of available stores for your shopping needs.

Each game campaign provides their own small quest to get access to the Magic Store of Vergadain.

### Alternate portrait for Ghostly Merchant *(requires main component)*

This optional component installs an alternate portrait version of the Ghostly Merchant without ghostly features.
