Overview
~~~~~~~~

The game contains a great number of stores for your shopping needs. However, finding or returning
to a store can take a lot of time or is sometimes not even possible.

This mod allows you to acquire a magical artifact that provides the means to visit any store you
have visited in the past. Getting your hands on this unique artifact involves a small quest of
one kind or another.

The mod supports original BG2, Tutu, BGT, BG:EE (with or without SoD), BG2:EE, EET and IWD:EE.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive
into your game directory and run either "setup-A7-MagicStore.exe" (Windows) or
"setup-A7-MagicStore.command" (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.

To uninstall, run "setup-A7-MagicStore.exe" (Windows) or "setup-A7-MagicStore.command" (macOS)
again and follow the prompts.


Installation order & mod compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mod tracks vanilla game stores as well as stores added by mods. It is recommended to install
it after content-adding mods (such as NPC or quest mods) to ensure all stores are considered.

There are no compatibility issues known with other mods. However, because stores are scanned and
processed automatically it is possible to access plot-dependent stores that are supposed to be
accessible only for a limited period of time as well as stores which are replaced by improved
versions at a certain point in the game or quest stage.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Magic Store of Vergadain (for BG2, Tutu, BGT, BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE, EET and IWD:EE)

This is the main component. It installs the artifact "Magic Store of Vergadain" and associates it
with a small quest.

The Magic Store keeps track of the stores you visit throughout the game, so you can visit them later
at any time and place even if the original store becomes unavailable. Activating the artifact
summons a ghostly merchant who offers a list of available stores for your shopping needs.

Each game campaign provides their own small quest to get access to the Magic Store of Vergadain.
The quest usually starts by acquiring a book about forgotten artifacts. It can be found in:
BG1:     Somewhere in Beregost.
SoD:     In the opening dungeon.
BG2:SoA: Somewhere at Waukeen's Promenade in Athkatla.
BG2:ToB: Somewhere in Saradush.
IWD:EE:  Somewhere in Kuldahar.

Only one Magic Store can be acquired in the whole game. For example, if you acquired the Magic
Store in EET during the BG1 campaign you can't get another one during the SoD, BG2:SoA or BG2:ToB
campaigns.


2. Alternate portrait for Ghostly Merchant (requires main component)

This optional component installs an alternate portrait version of the Ghostly Merchant without
ghostly features.
